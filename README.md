# UNO
UNO Game
This is an implementation of UNO game in c++ using object-oriented concepts.  Here I made some assumptions from the original UNO game.
	This version of my game is not including Action cards or Wild cards.
	As original game that player who is not saying UNO while they are having one card, must draw two new cards as a penalty. This version of my game does not have any     penalty. There is no chance to miss to saying UNO. Its loops automatically test with a condition.
	Iâ€™m assuming the total points for win the game is 50 because I would like to reduce the rounds and get quick result of the game.
